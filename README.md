# Keireki Craft

A local-first CV editor: guided form, live preview and an extensible template
system. Everything runs in the browser — no account, no server, no connection
required. Implementation of [`spec-cv-editor-en.md`](./spec-cv-editor-en.md),
phases 1 to 4.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173/vue-cv-maker/
npm test           # unit tests (Vitest)
npm run typecheck  # vue-tsc
npm run build      # production bundle into dist/
```

## What is implemented

| Phase | Scope | State |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Core | `CVData` model, store with persistence, full wizard, `classic` template, live preview, PDF export, JSON import/export | ✅ |
| 2 — Templates | Auto-discovery registry, `modern` and `compact`, style tokens, uneven capabilities, HTML export, paged.js | ✅ |
| 3 — PDF import | pdf.js extraction, heuristics, review screen with manual assignment | ✅ |
| 4 — Polish | Multi-CV management, section reordering, custom sections, mobile layout, undo/redo | ✅ |
| 5–6 — Backend | Stateless FastAPI service, then sync | Not started (out of scope for v1) |

The app is deliberately usable with the backend permanently absent: nothing in
phases 1–4 talks to a server.

## Architecture

```
src/
├── types/cv.ts          the central contract — everything else depends on it
├── core/                model factories, schema migrations, history, debounce
├── stores/              cv (data + undo/redo + autosave), ui (view state)
├── services/
│   ├── storage/         StorageAdapter interface + IndexedDB implementation
│   ├── export/          render → HTML / print / JSON; paged.js lives only here
│   └── pdfImport/       extract (pdf.js) → analyze (heuristics) → assemble
├── templates/           one folder per template, auto-registered
└── components/          form (wizard steps), preview, import, documents, ui
```

Four rules hold the design together, and each has a test guarding it:

1. **One source of truth per template.** A single `.vue` component serves the
   live preview, the printable HTML and the PDF. `services/export/render.ts`
   mounts it off-screen for the non-interactive outputs.
2. **Templates are pure.** Exactly one prop (`data: CVData`), no store access, no
   mutation, no hardcoded colors or fonts. Enforced by
   `tests/templateContract.test.ts`.
3. **Data is never lost.** A template that lacks a capability *ignores* the
   related data; switching back restores it. Imports and migrations fill missing
   fields rather than dropping unknown ones.
4. **paged.js is encapsulated.** It appears in `services/export/pdf.ts` and
   nowhere else, always on a container outside the Vue-managed tree, and plain
   `window.print()` remains a complete fallback if it is dropped.

## Adding a template

Create `src/templates/<id>/` with an `index.ts` default-exporting a
`TemplateDefinition` and a `Template.vue` taking `data: CVData`. The registry
picks it up through `import.meta.glob` — no existing file changes. The contract
test suite runs against it automatically.

Declare only the capabilities the template actually renders (`photo`, `sidebar`,
`accentColor`, `customFont`, `multiPage`); the wizard dims the controls it cannot
honour and keeps the data untouched.

## Storage

| Key | Contents |
|---|---|
| `cv:{id}` | the full `CVData` |
| `photo:{id}` | the photo as a `Blob` |
| `index` | `CVSummary[]` for the document list |

Photos are stored as blobs (≈33% smaller than base64) and resolved to object URLs
at render time. Exported JSON inlines the photo as base64 so the file stays
self-contained. `localStorage` holds only UI preferences.

Private browsing and quota failures are detected and surfaced, and the app asks
for `navigator.storage.persist()` on startup.

## PDF import

Three stages, all client-side:

1. **Extract** — `pdf.js` text fragments grouped into lines by Y coordinate,
   keeping font size and weight.
2. **Analyze** — direct fields by regex, date ranges in Spanish and English,
   name by largest first-page text, section headers by keyword + size + weight +
   line shape. Pure functions, no DOM.
3. **Review** — nothing is applied silently. Low-confidence fields are flagged,
   unclassified blocks default to *discard*, and the full raw text is always
   available.

Two-column and heavily designed CVs extract badly; the review screen is what makes
an imperfect extraction useful. Scanned PDFs are detected and reported — OCR is
out of scope.

## Browser support

Chrome and Firefox are the tested targets. Print output differs slightly between
browsers; Chrome currently gives the closest match to the on-screen preview.

## Deployment

Published at <https://dav1ddq0.github.io/vue-cv-maker/> by `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`: every
push to `main` installs, runs the tests, builds and deploys to GitHub Pages. A red test suite blocks
the deploy.

- **One-time setup:** repository *Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: GitHub Actions*.
- **Base path:** `vite.config.ts` defaults to `/vue-cv-maker/`, the project-site path, so
  `npm run preview` behaves like production. Set `BASE_PATH` to build for another location, for
  example `BASE_PATH=/ npm run build` for a user site or a custom domain.
- **Content-Security-Policy:** the build adds a CSP `<meta>` tag (GitHub Pages cannot send headers);
  it is not applied by `npm run dev`.
